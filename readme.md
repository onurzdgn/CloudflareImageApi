## Cloudflare Laravel Image

This package is the code that I used in a single project and has been edited to make it usable in many projects. Since I need these functions in more than one project, I have prepared and presented them as a package.

## Requirement

> Laravel >= 9
>
> Php >= 8.0

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
$ composer require onurozdogan/cloudflare-image-api
```
